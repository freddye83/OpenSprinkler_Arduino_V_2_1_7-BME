=====

**EtherCardWrapper** is a minimal set of functions to wrap either the ENC28J60 ethernet interface, or standard Arduino Wiznet5100 functionality, for OpenSprinkler.

The library DOES NOT implement all functionality - if there are additional parts of the EtherCard interface needed please do add to this code and issue a 'push' request via Github.

The code for this wrapper is available on [GitHub][1]

The original Ethercard Library is available on [GitHub][2]
